A thesis project.
This is a simulation in Julia in which we can see that with a simple local interaction we obtain a global optimal solution for the problem of finding a shortest path.
Can be used for example in robotics, using a single agent/robot that find a shortest path inside of a partially observable enviroment would be expensive and hard.
Instead we can use (lots) easy,cheap agents to find the shortest path.
