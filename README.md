A thesis project.
This is a simulation in Julia in which we can see that with a simple local interaction we obtain a global optimal solution for the problem of finding a shortest path.
Can be used for example in robotics, using a single agent/robot that find a shortest path inside of a partially observable enviroment would be expensive and hard.
Instead we can use (lots) easy,cheap agents to find the shortest path.

This is my contribution in which the ants are able to deal with obstacles. To do that they use an heuristic which is the (white) ant that behaves like a "ghost",
the other ants try to follow the "ghost" ant.
